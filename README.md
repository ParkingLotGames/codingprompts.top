Personal collection of Coding Prompts I used to have hosted in the [Superpower ChatGPT extension](https://github.com/saeedezzati/superpower-chatgpt) but said extension has become [sucky and buggy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/).
Since I only used the extension to access my own prompts, I decided to remove them from there and host them in a simple HTML Page.

### NOTE: This is a static page, there's no search bar or anything fancy at the moment and will likely stay that way.
